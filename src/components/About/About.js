                About Project</h2>
            I started this project when the Russian army invaded my motherland, and I had to keep checking not only the news but also the exchange rates.
            <br /><br />
            I was sitting on the xe.com and watching hryvnia going down and down. Yet, despite all the circumstances, I was fascinated by xe.com's website design. I started to think of coding something similar but making it more trendy and colorful. I wanted to save as much functionality and similarity as possible but leave myself enough room for creativity and experiments.
            <br /><br />
            This is my first big project. It helped me to learn and grow. Here I first used such languages and libraries as SCSS, MUI, Swiper, and Recharts.
            <br /><br />
            This project taught me how & when to use third-party libraries efficiently and how to choose the right one from them. I tried a bunch of libraries before I eventually chose Swiper and Rechart. That includes reading documentation, watching the code, analyzing functionality & features, bugs, and overall maintenance.
            <br /><br />
            I also deeply understood the importance of code refactoring, and I became very aware of the readability and cleanness of my code. I took a lot of challenging tasks, but that improved my problem-solving skills and the ability to be consistent too.
            <br /><br />
            This project means a lot to me. It taught me so much and I'm proud of having it deployed on GitHub Pages.

                About Me</h2>
            My name is Yana.
            <br /><br />
            I'm a software developer from Ukraine. Now I live in Tallinn, Estonia.
            <br /><br />
            In my projects, I mainly use JS, TS, React, Redux, CSS, and HTML. I am also proficient in other languages and libraries, such as MobX.
            <br /><br />
            Additionally, I have 7 years of experience as a designer, so I can make a Web App look good according to the best UI/UX standards.
            <br /><br />
            I enjoy algorithmic tasks as much as design-heavy projects.
            <br /><br />
            My team, where I was the only frontend developer, won a prize at a company Hackathon for our product's frontend experience.
            <br /><br />
            Besides this project, I've been working on a bunch of open-source projects, which you can find on my üëâüèª <a href='https://github.com/sinxenon/'>GitHub account</a>
            <br /><br />
            My hobbies are: learning foreign languages, drawing, playing D&D (tabletop roleplaying game), and reading.
