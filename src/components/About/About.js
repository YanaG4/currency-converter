            My name is Yana.
            <br /><br />
            I'm a Frontend developer from Ukraine. Now I live in Tallinn, Estonia.
            <br /><br />
            I hanve a hands-on experience in JS, TS, React, Redux, CSS and HTML. I deliver sleek, efficient, and user-friendly digital experiences globally. I'm curious and love to learn new technologies and constantly improve my knowledge and skills!
            <br /><br />
            Additionally, I have experience as a designer, and I ensure your Web App will look amazing across all devices and aligned with the best UI/UX standards.
            <br /><br />
            I enjoy algorithmic tasks as much as design-heavy projects.
            <br /><br />
            My team, where I was the only frontend developer, won a prize at a company Hackathon for our <a href='https://yanag4.github.io/public-holiday-calendar/'>product's frontend experience</a>.
            <br /><br />
            Besides this project, I've been working on a bunch of open-source projects, which you can find on my üëâüèª <a href='https://github.com/yanag4/'>GitHub account</a>
            <br /><br />
            My hobbies are: coding, learning foreign languages, drawing, playing D&D (tabletop roleplaying game), and reading.
